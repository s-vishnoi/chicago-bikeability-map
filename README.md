# Chicago Bikeability Map

An interactive cartogram visualizing bike traffic crashes and infrastructure across Chicago community areas.

This tool highlights crash counts, causes, and severity for each community area. It also scores biking infrastructure and network in each area and aggregates them into a custom Bikeability rank. Users can glean city-wide insights and help identify areas for improvement.

## Features


- **Interactive Cartogram** of Chicago‚Äôs community areas  
- **Crashes**: See and compare total bike crashes with leading causes across communities since 2018. 
- **Injury**: rates of severe (fatal, incapacitating), and non-severe injuries.
- **Infrastructure**: See miles of bike lanes per community by type- Protected, Neighborhood, Buffered, Bike (Painted), Shared. Compare to total road miles in the area. 
- **Network**: See ease of lane availability for bikers in the community (see diagram below) forming a bike network. 
- **Bikeability:** Final community rank (1-5), based on Infrastructure and Network scores.
